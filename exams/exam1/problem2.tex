\item Nine ping-pong balls, numbered 1 through 9 are placed into an urn. Four are randomly drawn, without replacement.

\begin{enumerate}

\item How many sets of four numbers are possible if the order of the numbers does not matter? (6 pts)

\ansfont{ There are $9\choose4$=$\frac{9!}{4!5!}=126$ different sets.
}
\vfill

\item What is the probability that exactly one of the four numbers is even? (7 pts)

\ansfont{ Let A=\{``Exactly one Even''\}. \\
Then $P(A)=\frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$. $|A|$=$4\choose1$$5\choose3$=40. Thus $P(A)=\frac{40}{126}\approx 0.3175.$
}
\vfill


\item What is the probability that at least three of the four numbers are even? (7 pts)

\ansfont{ Let B=\{``At least three of the numbers are even''\}. \\
Then $|B|$=$4\choose3$$5\choose1$+$4\choose4$$5\choose0$=21, so $P(B)=\frac{|B|}{|\Omega|}=\frac{21}{126}\approx 0.1667.$

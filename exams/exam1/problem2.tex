\item Nine ping-pong balls, numbered 1 through 9 are placed into an urn. Four are randomly drawn, without replacement.

\begin{enumerate}

\item How many sets of four numbers are possible if the order of the numbers does not matter? (6 pts)

\ansfont{ There are $9\choose4$=$\frac{9!}{4!5!}=126$ different sets.
}
\vfill

\item What is the probability that exactly one of the four numbers is even? (7 pts)

\ansfont{ Let A=\{``Exactly one Even''\}. \\
Then $P(A)=\frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$. $|A|$=$4\choose1$$5\choose3$=40. Thus $P(A)=\frac{40}{126}\approx 0.3175.$
}
\vfill


\item What is the probability that at least one of the four numbers is even? (7 pts)

\ansfont{ 
Let B=\{``At least one of the numbers is even''\}. Then $\bar B$=\{``All four are odd''\}, and $P(B)=1-P(\bar B)$. \\
Then $|\bar B|$=$5\choose4$=5, so $P(B)=1-\frac{|\bar B|}{|\Omega|}=1-\frac{5}{126}\approx 0.9603.$

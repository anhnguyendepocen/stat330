\item An eyewitness testifies that he saw the suspect in a blue car, but the sighting was late at night under poor conditions. 
The defense team tests the ability of the eyewitness under those conditions and finds the following probabilities

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|rrr|}
& \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Eyewitness reports} \\
True color & Blue & Green & Red \\
\hline
Blue & 0.8 & 0.1 & 0.1 \\ 
Green & 0.2 & 0.7 & 0.1 \\
Red & 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.6 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item if the car is blue, the eyewitness reports blue 90\% of the time
% \item if the car is green, the eyewitness reports blue 20\% of the time 
% \item if the care is red, the eyewitness reports blue 10\% of the time
% \end{itemize}
For example, if the car is red, the eyewitness reports green 30\% of the time. 
If this city has 50\% red cars, 30\% green cars, and 20\% blue cars, what is the probability the car is actually blue? (20 pts)

Notation
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $E_B$, $E_G$, and $E_R$ be the events that the eyewitness reports blue, green, and red, respectively. 
\item Let $C_B$, $C_G$, and $C_R$ be the events that the car is truly blue, green, and red, respectively. 
\end{itemize}
The following probabilities are relevant for the calculation
\[ \begin{array}{rl}
P(C_B) &= 0.2 \\
P(C_G) &= 0.3 \\
P(C_R) &= 0.5 \\
P(E_B|C_B) &= 0.8 \\
P(E_B|C_G) &= 0.2 \\
P(E_B|C_R) &= 0.1 \\
\end{array} \]
We need to calculate 
\[ \begin{array}{rll}
P(C_B|E_B) &= \frac{P(E_B|C_B)P(C_B)}{P(E_B|C_B)P(C_B)+P(E_B|C_G)P(C_G)+P(E_B|C_R)P(C_R)} & \mbox{by Bayes' Rule} \\
&= \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.8 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.3 + 0.1 \times 0.5} \\
&= \frac{0.16}{0.16+0.06+0.05} \\
&= 0.59
\end{array} \]

\item You are working on a new photo compression algorithm. In a test set of 16 
photos, you find an average compressed size of 1.8 Mb and a standard deviation
of 0.31 Mb. The standard compressed size for this test set is 2.0 Mb. For the 
following questions, assume the compressed sizes are independent and follow a 
normal distribution. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find a pvalue for the null hypothesis that the mean compressed size is actually 2.0 Mb. (7 pts)

\ansfont{
\[ 
t = \frac{1.8-2.0}{0.31/\sqrt{16}} = -2.58
\]
and thus 
\[ 
p = 2P(T_{17} > 2.67) = 0.021
\]
From the table, we know that $p> 2\cdot 0.01 = 0.02$.
}
\vfill\vfill\vfill

\item Draw a conclusion about the null hypothesis at significance level 0.01. (6 pts)

\ansfont{
At the 0.01 significance level we fail to reject the null hypothesis since the 
pvalue is larger than 0.01. 
}
\vfill\vfill

\item Construct a 95\% confidence interval for the true mean compressed size. (7 pts)

\ansfont{
\[
1.8 \pm t_{15,0.025} 0.31/\sqrt{16} = (1.63,1.97)
\]
}

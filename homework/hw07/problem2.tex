  \item A network router operates as an M/M/1/10 queue, with data packets arriving as
    a Poisson process, being stored in a buffer, and then, in the order of their arrival, sent onwards
    by a processor. The attempted arrival rate is $\lambda= 1/$millisecond, and the processor operates at a rate of $\lambda_S = 1.2$/millisecond. Any packets arriving at times when the buffer is already full are discarded.
   % {\it Note that since we are using an M/M/1/10 queue, $K=10$ is the number of packets in the entire system.}
    \begin{enumerate}
%      \item Draw the transition diagram for this system. 
      \item Find the expected time until the next change of system state if the buffer is currently
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item empty;
          \item full;
          \item neither empty nor full.
        \end{enumerate}
      \item Find the steady-state distribution (pmf) of the system
        (report probabilities with 4 decimal places).
      \item Find the probability that the processer is busy.
      \item Find the average number of packets in the system.
      \item Find the rate that arriving packets are {\bf discarded}. 
      \item Find the expected length of time spent by each packet in the system.

              In this case the only possible change is to $X(t)=1$. Let $I_1=$
              inter-arrival time and know $I_1 \sim Exp(1)$. Thus expected  time
              to change is $E(I_1)=1$ ms

              In this case the only possible change is to $X(t)=9$. Let $I_2=$
              service time and know $I_2 \sim Exp(1.2)$. Thus the expected
              time to change is  $E(I_2)=1/1.2=.83\bar{3}$ ms

              In this case the only possible change is to $X(t)=k-1$ or

              arrival or a death, and know $Y \sim Exp(2.2)$. Thus the expected

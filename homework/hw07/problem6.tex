\item Internet users visit a certain web site according to an $M/M/\infty$ 
queuing system with an arrival rate of 2/minute and an expected visit time of 
5 minutes. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the expected number of visitors at the web site at any time?
\item What is the fraction of time when nobody is browsing the site?
\item What is the probability there are more than 20 users on the site at a 
time?
\end{enumerate}

\ansfont{
The arrival rate is 2 per minute and the service rate is 1/5=0.2 per minute. 
Thus $r = \lambda_A/\lambda_S = 2/0.2 = 10$. Since this is a $M/M/\infty$ 
queuing system, the steady-state distribution is a Poisson distribution with 
mean $r$, i.e. $X\sim Po(r)$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Thus the expected number of users at any given time is $E[X] = 10$ users.
\item The fraction of time when nobody is at the website is 
\[ 
P(X=0) = e^{-r} = e^{-10} \approx 0.0000454.
\]
\item The probability that there are more than 20 users is 
\[ 
P(X>20) = 1-P(X\le 20) = 1-0.998 = 0.002.
\]
\end{enumerate}

\item The file 'problem5.csv' contains 4 simulated response variables 
(y1,y2,y3,y4) for the same explanatory variable (x). Each response violates 
the model assumptions in one way. Determine which assumption is violated for 
each response and provide a plot that provides evidence for your determination.

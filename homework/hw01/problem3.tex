  \item Two fair dice are tossed and the number on each die is recorded, e.g. (3,2) indicates the first die had a 3 and the second die had a 2.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Determine the sample space (Hint: there are 36 outcomes.).
      \item What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers is 1?
      \item What is the probability that the sum is 6?
      \item What is the probability that the minimum of the two numbers is 3?
    \end{enumerate}

        \item The sample space is
          $\{(i,j)| i=1,\dots,6, j=1,\dots,6\}$. That means
          \begin{center}
            $\{ (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6),$\\
            $ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6),$\\
            $ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6),$\\
            $ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6),$\\
            $ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6),$\\
            $ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\}$.
          \end{center}
        \item The smallest value of the sum is 2 which is obtained by (1,1). Thus, the probability that the sum is 1 is 0.
        \item The corresponding sums of each outcome is
          \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{c|cccccc}
              & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6\\\hline
              1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &5 & 6 & 7\\
              2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8\\
              3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9\\
              4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10\\
              5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11\\
              6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12
            \end{tabular}
          \end{center}
          There are five 6s and thus there are 5 outcomes (out of 36 possible outcomes)
          that have sum as 6. The
          required probability is 5/36.
        \item The corresponding minimum of each outcome is
          \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{c|cccccc}
              & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6\\\hline
              1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
              2 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2\\
              3 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 3\\
              4 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 4\\
              5 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 5\\
              6 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6
            \end{tabular}
          \end{center}
          There are seven 3s and thus there are 7 outcomes (out of 36 possible outcomes)
          that have minimum as 3. The
          required probability is 7/36.

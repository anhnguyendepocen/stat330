 \item  During any minute, a computer device is either in a busy mode or in an idle mode. A busy mode is followed by an idle mode with probability 0.1. An idle mode is followed by a busy mode with probability 0.6. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item What is the 1-step transition matrix?
      \item Suppose that the device was in idle mode at 10:00 a.m. What is the
        probability that it will be busy at 10:02 a.m.?
      \item Suppose that the device was in idle mode at 10:00 a.m. today. Approximate the probability that it will be busy at noon tomorrow via steady state.
    \end{enumerate}

\ansfont{
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let State 1"=``busy" and State 2 = ``idle". Then the transition matrix is
  \[ P = \begin{blockarray}{ccc}
& 1 & 2 \\
\begin{block}{c(cc)}
1 & 0.9 & 0.1 \\
2 & 0.6 & 0.4 \\
\end{block}
\end{blockarray}
\]
\item The two-step transition matrix is
  \[ P^{(2)} = P^2=
\begin{pmatrix}
0.9 & 0.1 \\
0.6 & 0.4 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
0.9 & 0.1 \\
0.6 & 0.4 \\
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0.87 & 0.13 \\
0.78 & 0.22 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]
Thus $P(\mbox{``busy at 10:02am"}|\mbox{``idle at 10:00am"}) = 0.78$.
\item We need to calculate the steady-state distribution $\pi=(\pi_1, \pi_2)$.
  Solve $\pi P = \pi$ with $\pi_1+\pi_2=1$:
  \[
    \begin{cases}
      0.9 \pi_1 + 0.6 \pi_2 = \pi_1\\
      0.1\pi_1 + 0.4\pi_2 = \pi_2\\
      \pi_1+ \pi_2=1
    \end{cases}
    \implies
    \begin{cases}
      \pi_1=6\pi_2\\
      \pi_1+ \pi_2=1
    \end{cases}
    \implies \pi_1=6/7, \quad \pi_2=1/7
  \]
  Thus $P(\mbox{``busy at noon tomorrow"}|\mbox{``idle at 10:00am"}) \approx 6/7$.
\end{enumerate}

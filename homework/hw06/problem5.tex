\item Suppose that the telephone calls 
arriving at the switchboard of a small corporation follows a Poisson process.
Let $X(t)$ be the number of calls received by time $t$ that day, with $X(0)=0$.
Suppose that $\lambda=0.5$ calls per minute.
Assume that the number of calls arriving during any period has a Poisson distribution.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability that no calls will arrive in a 5-minute period?
\item What is the expected amount of time between the 10th and 11th callers?
\item On average, how much time is needed to get their 100th caller of the day?
\end{enumerate}

\ansfont{
\begin{enumerate}
\item As $X(t)$ values follows a Poisson($\lambda\,t$)
probability distribution, then $X(5) \sim Poisson(\lambda\cdot5=2.5)$, so 
\[P\left(X(5) = 0\right) = e^{-2.5}=.0821.\]
\item Let $I$ be the interarrival time between any two calls, and $I\sim Exp(\lambda)$,
so $E(I) = \frac1\lambda = 2$ minutes.
\item Let $T$ be the time needed until the 100th caller. Then $T\sim Gamma(100, 0.5)$
so $E(T)=\frac{100}{0.5}=200$ minutes.
\end{enumerate}

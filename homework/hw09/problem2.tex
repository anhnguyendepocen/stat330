    In assessing the desirability of windowless schools, officials asked 144
    elementary school children whether or not they like windows in their
    classrooms. 43 children preferred
    windows.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Establish a 95\% confidence interval of the proportion of elementary school
        children who like windows in their classrooms using substition method.
%      \item Establish the confidence interval in part (a) using conservative method.

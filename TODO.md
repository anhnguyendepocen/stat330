# To Do for next time

## Rearrange material

An attempt was made to avoid multiple random variable discussion until after the first midterm.
The textbook and previous lectures included multiple random variables after discussing discrete random variables because

1. They didn't want to get into multiple variable calculus. 
1. They could discuss properties of variances. 

I suggest that we put multiple discrete random variable discussion to immediately follow discrete random variable discussion. 

Should we be discusion multiple continuous random variables at all?
